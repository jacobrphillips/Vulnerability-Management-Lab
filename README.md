# Vulnerability Management Lab with Azure VM and Nessus Essentials

This repository contains instructions for setting up a Vulnerability Management Lab using Azure VM as a honeypot and Nessus Essentials for vulnerability scanning. The lab is designed to demonstrate the importance of vulnerability management and the effectiveness of using tools like Nessus to identify and mitigate security risks.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- An Azure account ([Sign up here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free))
- Nessus Essentials account ([Sign up here](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials))

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up Azure Account

**Purpose:** Create a cloud environment for hosting the vulnerable VM.

1. Sign up for an Azure account, or if you're a student, you can use the [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/students) program.

### Step 2: Set Up Nessus Account

**Purpose:** Obtain a vulnerability scanning tool for identifying security issues within the Azure VM.

1. Create a Nessus Essentials account on the [Tenable website](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials).

### Step 3: Create a VM in Azure

**Purpose:** Establish a virtual machine to serve as the honeypot for simulating real-world attack scenarios.

1. Create a virtual machine (VM) in Azure.
2. Edit the inbound security rule to allow necessary communication.
3. Test connectivity to ensure the VM is accessible from external sources.

### Step 4: Run Initial Scan

**Purpose:** Identify baseline vulnerabilities within the VM environment.

1. Run the initial scan using Nessus without any changes or credentials.
2. Enable necessary services such as Remote Registry and file sharing to facilitate scanning.
3. Adjust security settings to ensure Nessus can access and scan the VM effectively.

### Step 5: Add Credentials in Nessus

**Purpose:** Enhance scan accuracy by providing Nessus with valid credentials for authenticated scanning.

1. Enter the VM login credentials in Nessus to enable authenticated scanning.
2. This allows Nessus to access more areas of the VM, providing deeper insight into potential vulnerabilities.

### Step 6: Run Scan Again

**Purpose:** Conduct a comprehensive vulnerability scan with authenticated access to identify additional security issues.

1. Run the scan again using Nessus with the added credentials.

### Step 7: Compare Reports

**Purpose:** Analyze the differences between initial and subsequent scans to understand the impact of authenticated scanning.

1. Compare the reports from the initial scan and the scan with credentials to identify any differences in detected vulnerabilities.
2. This helps in understanding the effectiveness of authenticated scanning and the importance of proper credential management.

## Conclusion

This Vulnerability Management Lab demonstrates the importance of implementing proper security measures and regularly scanning for vulnerabilities. By using tools like Nessus Essentials and leveraging cloud infrastructure like Azure VMs, organizations can effectively manage and mitigate security risks.
